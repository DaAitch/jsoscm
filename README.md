# JavaScript Open-Source Contribution Munich

## Idea

At [JS Craft Camp](http://jscraftcamp.org/) we was having a small open space session about how to contribute to TC39 for example the [TC39/proposals](https://github.com/tc39/proposals). On the next day we did a [TC39/Test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262) hands-on mob session and played with the idea of kicking off a monthly contribution session.
